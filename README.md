# The Track Fitness Club
As a student looking to develop my skills in data analysis and make a tangible impact, I approached The Track Fitness Club, a struggling gymnasium located in my hometown, and convinced the owner to allow me to comb through the business's raw data, I analyzed various aspects of the business and identified underlying problems that may be hurting the business's profit-making capacity. I then developed data-driven recommendations for improvement and presented these findings in a final report.

The proposed solutions focus on increasing profits and address specific areas of the business identified through the analysis. I am proud to have been able to help The Track Fitness Club identify areas for improvement and develop strategies to increase profits.

 # Data

 "The data for this analysis was obtained from the gym's point of sale management software. I approached the reception desk, explained the situation to the staff, and set up a meeting with the business owner. I was able to convince the owner to give me access to the data for a period of 8 months, which included information about invoices generated, client personal information, and entry-exit digital logs. There were a total of three files collected: 
 a. 'invoice entries raw.xlsx', which contained digital entries for every invoice generated (1014 records with 17 features)
 b. 'PIPO raw.xlsx', which included digital logs of every successful/unsuccessful attempt to enter the workout space (about 32,000 recorded observations with 3 columns)
 c. 'PII raw.xlsx', which included personal information for clients (495 observations with 6 features). 
 
 The raw data was preprocessed using Microsoft Excel and Python as necessary. The data cleaning process included adding and removing features as needed, removing records that were not relevant to the analysis, and changing data types.

After organizing the data, I created visualizations to highlight key markers like monthly revenue, new clients per month, and busiest time slots for workouts. This revealed two significant issues.

1. poor client retention rate
2. overcrowding at peak hours. 

The client retention rate was a concern because it showed that the gym was losing a significant number of clients over time. The overcrowding issue was also problematic because it could lead to reduced customer satisfaction and even safety concerns. To address these issues, I set out to find a practical solution that I could easily pitch to the business owner. My goal was to find a simple yet effective solution to improve retention and manage capacity at the gym.
